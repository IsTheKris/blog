Hi there! Welcome to my blog, where I share my journey into the exciting world of data science. My goal is simple: to track my progress, document what I learn, and hopefully connect with others who share the same passion.

I’ve always loved technology, and as an M.Tech graduate in Computer Science, I’ve worked with GNU/Linux, server management, and programming. I even spent some time as a tutor, which I truly enjoyed—teaching is in my blood! But now, I feel it’s time for a change. Data science feels like the perfect fit for me because it combines logic, problem-solving, and creativity.

My college days, especially at the University of Hyderabad, were unforgettable. Studying there shaped the way I think and approach problems. Volunteering as a system admin at the SCIS lab gave me hands-on experience with servers and GNU/Linux, which was both challenging and rewarding.

Through this blog, I want to make learning fun and interactive—not just for myself but for anyone reading. If you find anything I’ve missed or have suggestions, don’t hesitate to reach out. Let’s grow together!
